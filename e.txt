Subject: Summary and Proposal on Host Key Issue

Dear Team,

I would like to summarize the recent meeting, discussions, and investigations regarding the host key issue and present a proposal for moving forward.

### What is a Host Key?

A host key is a cryptographic key used to verify the identity of a server in SSH connections. It ensures that the client is connecting to the intended server and not to an imposter.

### Why Use a Host Key?

The primary reasons for using a host key are to enhance security by preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring the integrity of the server-client connection.

### How to Use Host Key in VM and Java Application with JSch Library

**Using Host Key in a Virtual Machine (VM):**
- Ensure the host key is securely stored in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file 

**Using Host Key in a Java Application with JSch Library:**
- **When to Use**: Use a host key whenever establishing SSH connections to verify the server's identity.
- **Where to Store**: Store the host key securely in vault or in a secure storage solution. 
- **Implementation**:
  ```java
  JSch jsch = new JSch();
  //retrieve server host key from Vault
  //create host key Java object
  HostKey hostKey = new HostKey("server-hostname", Base64.getDecoder().decode(serverHostKey));
  //add hostkey java object into hostkey repository
  jsch.getHostKeyRepository().add(hostKey, null);
  ```

### Proposal to Use Host Key in Java Application

My proposal is to implement the use of host keys in our Java applications for the following reasons:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Adding a host key adds an additional layer of protection, reducing the risk of security breaches.
2. **Ease of Use**: Implementing host key verification in Java applications using the JSch library is straightforward.
3. **Client Expectation**: The Tibco team sends the host key to client teams, expecting them to use it for secure connections.

### Request for Feedback

I would appreciate your feedback on this proposal. Please let me know if you agree with this approach or if you have any suggestions 
or concerns. Your input is valuable to ensure we adopt the best practices for our security protocols.
